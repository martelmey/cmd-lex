Analog / Continuous signal
Continuously varying function over time
Radio waves, sound waves

Digital
Discrete values at discrete points in time
Horizontal axis is time
Digital signals are from the time domain / are time domain signals
Digital signal = sequence of number

Sampling
Values arrived upon by measuring a continuous signal
Analog > Digital converter
Samples/measures an analog signal at discrete periods in time
Value is at each sample point
Every value is a number

opposite/hypotenuse = sine (SOH)
adjacent/hypotenuse = cosine (CAH)
opposite/adjacent = tangent (TOA)
These functions only work on right triangles

Issue:
	Upon login, get message: The Group Policy Client service failed the sign-in. Access is denied.

Diagnostics:
	Check that the host hasn't lost its trust relationship with the domain.
	Test-ComputerSecureChannel should return True.

	Cached profile is broken on session host (SH).
	Go to SH C:\Users and rename <username> and <local_username> directory.
	And then you can restore data from profile.

Solutions:
	Check the NTUser.dat registry hive permissions.
	Open regedit.
	Select HKEY_USERS in the left pane. Click the File menu and choose the Load Hive option.
	Select All Files in the Files of type box. Navigate to the affected user’s profile folder (under C:\Users folder) and select the NTUSER.DAT file. Click Open.
	Provide any name for the new hive, e.g. TestHive.
	Set proper registry hive permissions under the TestHive section. The owner user as well as the System account at minimum should have full control enabled.
	In regedit, select File –> Unload hive.
	Logoff the user gracefully and try again.

Method 1: Binary Method{
	Network/Subnet address: fill host portion of address w/ binary 0's
	Broadcast address: fill host portion of address w/ binary 1's
	First host: fill host portion of address w/ binary 0's except for last bit = binary 1
	Last host: fill host portion of address w/ binary 1's except for last bit = binary 0
}
Method 2: Quick Method

Multiple subnets

IP address{
	From which determine:
	- subnet address
	- 1st host address
	- last host address
	- broadcast address
}

192.168.1.18/24{
	Subnet = 192.168.1.00000000 = 192.168.1.0
	1st host = 192.168.1.00000001 = 192.168.1.1
	Broadcast = 192.168.1.11111110 = 192.168.1.254
}

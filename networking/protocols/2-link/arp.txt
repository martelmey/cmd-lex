1.) requesting the MAC address of the queried IP:
Layer 2: Ethernet II Header
0060.3EE7.1199 >> FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
ARP Packet Src. IP: 10.1.1.99, Dest. IP: 10.1.1.100
2.) send broadcast frame to switch
3.) switch floods the broadcast (sends from all ports)
4.) nodes on those ports will drop the packet if they don't have the requested IP to resolve to MAC

out-of-band = a separate stream of data from the main data stream

# REPEATERS

# HUBS
layer 1
Cisco FastHub 400 series
Hub = multi-port repeater
A Wifi network is a hub in the air
No intelligence
Traffic is received on one port, and floods it to all other ports

# BRIDGE
between switch and hub
learns MAC addresses in software

# SWITCH
all ports enabled by default
ports start at 1/0/1
Catalyst 3560-CG/CX
Cisco 3750 (2960)
layer 2
Switch has intelligence
Reads the frames received on ethernet
Uses MAC address table
Receives and forwards the frames out of the correct ports
Traffic is received on one port, for a certain MAC, and comes out of the port associated with that MAC only
Uses hardware Application Specific Integrated Circuits to learn MAC addresses
can have routing capabilities

# ROUTER
all ports disabled by default
ports start at 0/0/0
Cisco 4321
layer 3
1800 series cisco router (4321, 3560cx)
routes from one IP network to another

# FIREWALL
in front of or behind the router
# IDS
intrusion detection system
alert only
sits outside traffic, just receives copies
# IPS
intrusion prevention system
automatically block
sits inside traffic

# WLAN CONTROLLER
autonomous AP = no wlan controller
controls lightweight APs

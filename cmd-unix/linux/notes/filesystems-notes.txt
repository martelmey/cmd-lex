It is conventional wisdom that a swap space double the size of your RAM should be created.

I use two basic partition schemes. The first is for a desktop. I make 4 partitions, /, /home, /usr/local, and swap. This lets me re-install or upgrade the entire installation under / without wiping out my data files under /home or my custom compiled applications under /usr/local. For servers, I often replace the /usr/local partition with a /var partition. Many different servers store information on that partition and having it kept separate from / has certain performance benefits.

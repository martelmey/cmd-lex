Fingerprinting {
	Which ports on a network are listening, and whether any devices such as firewalls are intermediate to the sender & receiver.
}

Vulnerability Management Lifecycle {
	1. Discovery
		- Nmap
	2. Prioritization
	3. Assessment
		- Nessus / Nexpose
		- Open VAS
	4. Reporting
	5. Remediation
	6. Verification
}

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) {
	https://openvas.org/
	Framework of tools & services for vulnerability scanning & management systems.
	Search of networked devices, accessible ports ad services.
	Competitor to Nexpose and Nessus.
	Engine: Network Vulnerability Tests (NVT)

	OpenVAS Manager
		* Manager of the processes
		* Controls the scanner using OpenVAS Transfer Protocol (OTP) and OpenVAS Managemet Protocols (OMP)
		* Schedules scans, manages report generation
		* Runs on a SQL DB where results are stored

	Greenbone Security Manager (GSM) GUI alternative:
	Greenbone Security Assistant
}

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

NVD (National Vulnerability Database) {
	Quantitative analysis of vulnerabilities based on:
		* Access vector
		* Complexity
		* Authentication
		* Impact to confidentiality, integrity, & availability
	Scored 0 to 10
		* 0 None
		* 0.1-3.9 Low
		* 4.0-6.9 Medium
		* 7.0-8.9 High
		* 9.0-10 Critical
}

Socket/Endpoint

Ports {
	0-65535 (total)
	0-1023 (well-known)

	Open: App actively listening
	Closed: Probe received, no app listening
	Filtered: Unknown, probe dropped
	Unfiltered: Accessible, can't discern
	Open/Filtered: No state established
	Closed/Filtered: Unable to discern anything

	Scans {
		Vanilla {
			All 65536, easily detectable
		}
		SYN {
			Sends a SYN, doesn't wait for response. Faster.
			-sS
		}
		Strobe {
			Selective attempts to connect t select ports, < 20.
		}
		Stealth {

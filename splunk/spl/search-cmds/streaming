	* Removes the events that contain an identical combination of values for the fields that you specify.

	<SYNTAX>

		dedup
		[<int>]
		<field-list>
		[keepevents=<bool>]
		[keepempty=<bool>]
		[consecutive=<bool>]
		[sortby <sort-by-clause>]

		<field-list>
			Syntax: <string> <string> ...
			Description: A list of field names to remove duplicate values from.

		<consecutive>
			Syntax: consecutive=<bool>
			Description: If true, only remove events with duplicate combinations of values that are consecutive.
			Default: false

		<keepempty>
			Syntax: keepempty=<bool>
			Description: If set to true, keeps every event where one or more of the specified fields is not present (null).
			Default: false. All events where any of the selected fields are null are dropped.

		<keepevents>
			Syntax: keepevents=<bool>
			Description: If true, keep all events, but will remove the selected fields from events after the first event containing a particular combination of values.
			Default: false. Events are dropped after the first event of each particular combination.

		<N>
			Syntax: <int>
			Description: The dedup command retains multiple events for each combination when you specify N. The number for N must be greater than 0. If you do not specify a number, only the first occurring event is kept. All other duplicates are removed from the results.

		<sort-by-clause>
			Syntax: sortby ( - | + ) <sort-field> [(- | +) <sort_field> ...]
			Description: List of the fields to sort by and the sort order. Use the dash symbol ( - ) for descending order and the plus symbol ( + ) for ascending order. You must specify the sort order for each field specified in the <sort-by-clause>. The <sort-by-clause> determines which of the duplicate events to keep. When the list of events is sorted, the top-most event, of the duplicate events in the sorted list, is retained.

		<sort-field>
			Syntax: <field> | auto(<field>) | str(<field>) | ip(<field>) | num(<field>)
			Description: The options that you can specify to sort the events.

		<field>
			Syntax: <string>
			Description: The name of the field to sort.

		<auto>
			Syntax: auto(<field>)
			Description: Determine automatically how to sort the field values.

		<ip>
			Syntax: ip(<field>)
			Description: Interpret the field values as IP addresses.

		<num>
			Syntax: num(<field>)
			Description: Interpret the field values as numbers.

		<str>
			Syntax: str(<field>)
			Description: Order the field values by using the lexicographic order.

	<EXAMPLES>

		* Remove duplicate results and sort results in ascending order
		... | dedup source sortby +_time

		* Keep the first 3 duplicate results
		... | dedup 3 source

		* Keep results that have the same combination of values in multiple fields
		... | dedup 2 source host

		* Remove only consecutive duplicate events
		... | dedup consecutive=true source host
}

| rename {
	* https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.0/SearchReference/Rename
	* Use the rename command to rename one or more fields.

	<EXAMPLES>

	* Rename with a phrase
	... | rename SESSIONID AS "The session ID"

	* Rename multiple, similarly named fields
	... | rename *ip AS *IPaddress

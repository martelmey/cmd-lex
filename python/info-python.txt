A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool. Modules are also often referred to as “libraries” or “packages” — a package is really a directory that holds a collection of modules.
from module_name import object_name

Notice that when we want to invoke the randint() function we call random.randint(). This is default behavior where Python offers a namespace for the module. A namespace isolates the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module from the code in the file doing the importing. Your local namespace, meanwhile, is where your code is run.
import module_name as name_you_pick_for_the_module

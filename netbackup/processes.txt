# Media:
bpbrm = sends meta data about the backup to the master server
bptm = writes the backup data to storage

# Client:
bpkar
bpcd = port 13724, once backup request comes in, vnetd hands request over to bpcd. bpcd checks master and media servers are good, checks IPs and hostnames
vnetd = port 1556, listens for requests from master or media servers (i.e. backup or restore)

# Explanations:
nbpem asks bpdm if there's jobs to run
nbpem goes through nbproxy to talk to bpdm
when you create a backup, you create an image; find out what the catalog's backup id is using bpimagelist(id=kutlprdnetb01-mgmt_1620328915)
expire image

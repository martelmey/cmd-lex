# 1 delay = .015 seconds

#normal restore
storage server rehydrates data
least busy media server is chosen to move data to client
media server must have credentials for msdp deduplication engine
media server bptm process moves data to client

#client-direct restore
causes restore data to bypass the media server & bptm
msdp data is sent directly to the client for rehydration
allows decryption and decompression to be performed by either the storage server or the client
recommended if doing lots of restores

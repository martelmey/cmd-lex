NB Management > Host properties {
	Retention Periods
	Global Attributes {
		Maximum jobs per client: default is 1, increase to 20
	}
	Servers {
		Add other GUI servers (cutlmgtops01)
	}
	Media {
		if we get tape, allow all media overwrite options
		just in case tapes come pre-formatted, we can overwrite
	}
	Timeouts {
		you can increase for troubleshooting
	}
	Client Attributes {
		click client, then offline backups until: to temporarily pause backups for that host
	}
	Logging {
		increase debug level here for troubleshooting / support cases
		may require a reboot of affected services
	}
	Resource Limit {
		play in here once we get vmware
		otherwise will backup all the guests at once, cause crash
	}
	SLP Parameter {
		Pending AIR import threshold = keep at 24 hours
		Maximum size per AIR replication job = keep at 100GB
		It's like waiting to fill the dishwasher before starting

Storage > Storage Lifecycle Policies
# for moving data around
Add Backup task, Add Replication task

Storage > Catalog
	Action: Verify
see dedupe ratios falling: go back in time to see if anything is wrong with the msdp pool
Verify will go and read that disk, and pretend to do a restore to verify if a restore is possible
	Action: Import
If data is written to tape, and is expired, it is not deleted from tape, only deleted from database, unless tape is overwritten
You could import the un-deleted but expired info back into the database, and then restore, but write-lock the tape first
The imported data will have its original retention period restored
When netbackup expires data on disk (image clean), info in database is expired, and then is deleted from disk
You have 12 hours from the point of expiry to the point of image clean, to re-import the expired data to the database
2 phases to an import
press initialize import button
image type: disk
disk type: pure disk
will check to see if there is anything that CAN be imported
	Action: Duplication
Replication: take a backup in one domain, and replicate to another domain
Duplication: stays within a domain (example: copy from disk to tape, or between pools within same domain)
When duplicating you will probably set up a SLP (storage lifecycle policy)
example: upon replicating, it can then be duplicated
can differentiate between copy #s, and the 'primary' copy
'primary' is the one nb will use for a restore, any # could be the copy
phase 1 initialization info will remain in the database for 1 week, for you to import

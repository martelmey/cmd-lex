level 0 = full backup
level 1 = differential incremental backup

When client is assigned new policy, full backup is done

# Schedule backup types:
Differential incremental backup = changes since last backup (lessen backup time)
Cumumlative incremental backup = changes since last full backup
User backup = specify server, users there can start backups from there
User archive = after backup, removed from originating server

# Schedule types:
Calendar (better)
Frequency (worst)
